# Project Plan: AI Client Configure

This document describes the staged approach used to build the **ai-client-configure**
command line utility. Each stage can be executed independently and verified before
moving to the next step.

## Stage 1 – Establish the foundation

- Create the Python package layout with `ai_client_configure/`.
- Implement the core configuration dataclass and validation helpers.
- Provide a module entry point for use with `python -m ai_client_configure`.

## Stage 2 – Command line interface

- Add an ergonomic CLI built on top of `argparse`.
- Support the following subcommands:
  - `init`: scaffold a default configuration file.
  - `validate`: check a configuration file for schema violations.
  - `show`: display a configuration summary or raw JSON.
- Ensure that all subcommands share the `--config` option so the target file is easy
  to override.

## Stage 3 – Documentation and packaging metadata

- Expand the README with usage instructions and examples.
- Add a `pyproject.toml` describing the project metadata and CLI entry point.
- Document the staged approach in this file so contributors know how to extend the
  tool.

## Stage 4 – Quality gates

- Provide a small pytest suite that exercises configuration validation logic.
- Encourage running `pytest` locally before committing changes.
- Future work: integrate linters such as Ruff or mypy if type checking becomes
  necessary.
